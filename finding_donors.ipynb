    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "<b>Good fit for our problem</b>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boosted trees (AdaBoost)\n",
    "<b>Application:</b>\n",
    "- Financial Analysis, Control systems (1), textual classification (e.g. spam, fake news detection (2)). Should have the same general application as random forests but may not be the first choice when dealing with noisy data since then random forests usually perform better as they do not overfit as easily in that case. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advantages:</b>\n",
    "- Not that complex in terms of space and time complexity. Also works quite well in high dimensions compared to a pure decision tree (2) and yields usually very good results (3, 4, 5) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disadvantages:</b>\n",
    "- Can lead to high variance (overfitting) due to (unecessarily) complex tree structures and can also be numerically unstable. Furthermore, more sensitive to noise than random forests (6) and since the trees can not be trained independently, it can be computationally much more demanding than other techniques such as bagged trees and random forests (6) <br>\n",

    "<b>Good fit for our problem</b>\n",
    "- Similar reason to using the random forests mentioned above. Furthermore, comparative studies often show boosted trees (e.g. AdaBoost) performing better than bagged trees(3, 4, 5). However, since - depending on the data set - boosted trees can perform better than random forests, it may be a good idea to include both of these in our study and see which performs better. \n",

    "- Works well when the feature space is large compared to the numbers of training data. From all literature comparisons I have looked at (3, 4, 5), it seems like SVMs perform generally worse than the above mentioned ensemble methods but still usually rank above other methods like naive bayes, logistic regression and so on. \n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Good fit for our problem</b>\n",
    "- So far, we have just included ensemble tree based methods in our study. I think, it would be a good idea to also include SVMs to compare between tree- and kernel-based methods. Also, from the comparative studies, it seems like SVMs perform best in terms of F1 score and AUC for some of the data sets used (which I did not investigate thoroughly) in those comparative studies. Furthermore, our feature space is quite high dimensional.\n",

    "We have tested all the models mentioned earlier by training them on a subset of your data and then trying to predict individuals that make more than 50000 $. For this we used different ways for evaluating the model's performance on your data, which are a so-called F-score and the accuracy. The acuracy tells us how many of the predictions were actually correct. The F-score we used is chosen such that the precision of the model, which gives us a measure of how many people we predicted to have a >50K income did actually have such an income, is weighted higher than the so-called \"recall\", which basically the opposite metric telling us how many of the actually >50K income people we predicted correctly. The beauty of the F-score we chose is that it takes both of these metrics into account and raises a flag as soon as one of them becomes too low.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Actually, all the models we investigated performed quite well. However, the SVM model is computationally very demanding. It takes about two orders of magnitude more time than the tree based models we investigated and this would make the hyperparameter tuning - which we will perform next - almost infeasible.\n",
    "The Random Forest model also actually performs very well on the test data. But we also tested all of the models to make predictions on the training data again and there we saw that the Random Forest almost achieves 100 in all metrics. This is an indication that this model might tend to overfit, which basically means that it memorizes the training data.\n",

    "The AdaBoost model we are using is based on decision trees. You can imagine a decision tree such that you ask a binary question and depending on whether the answer is e.g. \"yes\" or \"no\" you walk down to the left or to the right and you arrive at a new leaf. There you will again be asked a question and you will again depending on your answer create a new set of leafs (left and right). If you complete this process many times and consider different pathes through the tree (different yes/no combinations), you will arrive at a very branched structure, which looks somewhat like a tree. Hence, the name \"decision tree\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we use these decision trees here is by asking many of such binary binary questions and by doing that walk through the tree. At the end - after arriving at a final leaf of the tree - we will arrive at a final classification/answer to our initial question, i.e. whether a person earns more or less than 50K $.\n",
    "The way we arrange  and order those questions (the nodes of the tree) is by maximizing the amount of information we gain by asking a certain question at a certain level of the tree. Hence, at each node we look at how much information we gain by asking all possible leftover categorial questions and we choose the one, which yields the maximum amount of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with decision trees is that they tend to become very deep and nested, which makes them prone to ooverfitting, i.e. just memorizing our training data. This is where adaptive boosting comes into play. The idea behind this is to start from one decision tree, which is trained such that it makes the least possible mistakes. We then increase the weight of the incorrectly classified points such that we can train a second decision tree on the model and this decision tree will then try its best to classifiy the previously incorrectly classified points correctly. We repeat this process for a fixed number of times (N) until we have a set of N weak learners/trees, which are all specilized in different regions for our problem and may also come to dfferent answers for a given input. When we want to make a prediction for a certain point, we then weigh the  the prediction of each weak learner based on the fraction of correctly and incorrectly classified training data such that we take the expertise of the different trees into account. We then add these weighted predictions up to obtain our final prediction."

    "    <li>I did expect that <b>capitol loss and gain</b> tend to stay mostly around 0 for most people and, hence, not being a good indicator of income. But obiously, it maks sense, that capital loss and gain have a high imppact on a. persons's income if my assumption of them being close to zero on average is not true. Capital loss and gain could then be proportional and anti-proportional to income. [Actually, I just realized that I should have looked at the distributions we got for these two features earlier (I forgot about those) to see that there actually is a high correlation to be expected] </li>\n",
    "    <li> I did not see that <b>hours per week</b> is is that important as many people with low income work very hard (1 - 3) jobs to get sufficient income to afford housing and food and some are just lazy or unemployed. Similar things should hold true for people with high income: Some (e.g. scientists, lawyers, etc.) work very hard/much but many others just let their capital work for them. I actually think that this part of the dataset might be flawed (given that it was obtained by asking people about their working hours) since most high income people would probably overestimate/exaggerate the number of working hours due to social status/prestige and so on. But obiously, this is just a hypothesis and would need to be tested.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The accuracy and F-score dropped by about 2 - 3 %. This is a quite good result given that the we dropped much more than 50 % of our features (especially, the ones with a lot of variation like e.g. country of origin). The results are still better than our naive assumption.\n",
